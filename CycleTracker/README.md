# CycleTracker

This intro-level tutorial walks through all the steps of building a basic progressive web app, or PWA. We will be using web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — to build a period tracking web app called "CycleTracker". Like all web apps, CycleTracker is designed to work in all browsers on all devices.

# PWA benefits

Using the languages of the web, we will create a fully functioning application that works both online and offline, both in the browsers and on the user's operating systems (OS). Like any regular website, CycleTracker is hosted on and downloadable from a web server. All we need is a text editor: CycleTracker, like all PWAs, doesn't require any additional programming language knowledge, packaging, or proprietary SDK. CycleTracker, like any PWA, can be seamlessly installed on any operating system without the need of app stores (nor app store approval and fees).

## Use standard and open web technologies

Historically, for an application to be installable on an OS, such as Windows, iOS, MacOS, Linux, and Android, the applications are developed in OS-supported programming languages, like C#, .Net, Objective C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, or Python. PWAs are based on a different model: they use a single code base, written using standard open web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that work across OSes.

## No compiling required

With most programming languages—like Java, C/C++, and Kotlin, which are commonly used for building Android apps, and Objective-C and Swift, for iOS—the code needs to be compiled and packaged into an installable format, like .exe, .dmg, .elf, and .apk, or another installable file type, depending on the operating system. Depending on the language, compiling and packaging may require the OS's SDK. PWAs use web technologies supported by every operating system that doesn't need to be packaged or compiled. Yes, developer teams can have complex build systems, but, as we will demonstrate as we build CycleTracker, PWAs can be built out of just HTML and JavaScript (and CSS, though styling is not necessarily required for a PWA).

## Available anywhere and everywhere

Single-OS-only applications are distributed to users through downloads, often in proprietary app stores. They are available through a vendor like the Apple App Store, Google Play, Microsoft Store, or similar. PWAs don't have these requirements. If you want to distribute your CycleTracker app, you won't require an intermediary. A user can access your app by visiting its online version. But if you want, it is possible to distribute your PWA on the Play Store and App Store, undifferentiated from other iOS or Android apps.

## Easy for the user to install

Historically, downloaded single-OS-only applications have to be intentionally installed by the user. Depending on the OS, install format, and download origin, this can be a multi-step installation process. PWAs are streamlined. PWAs are available to anyone with a supporting browser, and are installable with a couple of clicks.
